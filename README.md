# personal-library

This is a project created as part of The Odin Project's javascript course. It is a small library app, which allows you to add and remove books, mark them as read, and see updated library and reading stats.

This was built from scratch using vanilla html, css, and javascript. The primary purpose of the app was to practice using object constructors and prototypes to add and store data. Along the way, I deepened my knowledge of manipulating the DOM, creating modals and custom checkboxes, and saving and retrieving data to localStorage.
